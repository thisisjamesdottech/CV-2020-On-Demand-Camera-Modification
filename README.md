# CV-2020-On-Demand-Camera-Modification
 This script leverages Microsoft SQL Server to make bulk changes to camera On Demand settings.

 The use case for this came from a client needing to make all cameras on a handful of specific servers (out of a few hundred) to ensure network traffic is affected less by the servers in question only sending video feed when the camera is specifically selected ("on demand") in live view and/or part of a custom view of camera streams.
